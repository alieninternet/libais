This is the test suite for the LibAISutil library. It's designed to be
called from the top Makefile. To run these tests, run "make check" from the
top directory of this package.

If you experience a failure responce from these tests, further information
may be drawn about which tests are running by adding a parameter to the
program (anything will do). The testing stages, and information about what's
being tested, will be outputted to the console.
