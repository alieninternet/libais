This is where the socket code for the LibAISutil library is kept. Classes here
are combined to form a transport type. Only socket handlers are here (for
transport layer protocols such as tcp/ipv4, tcp/ipv6 etc).

Summary:
  domain* are for socket domains (i.e. protocols like IPv4, IPX etc)
  type* are for socket types (i.e. sub-protocol formats like STREAM, etc)
