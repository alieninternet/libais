Version 1.4
  * Time:: includes some more arithmetic operations. See the manual for more
    details
  * Socket routines are now contained the AIS::Util::Socket:: namespace. Some
    minor base class changed have occured, check the documentation for more
    details. Mostly, changing the namespace will be the only change required.
    This change is due to the long class names (prefixed with 'Socket') which
    were named prior to namespaces being available in C++.
  * Socket::Domain and Socket::Type (which both have become empty now) have
    been removed. Domain and Type ABC's now inherit directly from Socket to
    save on wasted virtual tables and RTTI.
  * Socket::read() has been reverted back to the old method (using a
    std::string) due to demand. A rewrite and reintegration of the iostreams
    wrapper for the Socket:: classes is planned eventually
  * Socket::* classes now have a much more flexible flag system. Check the
    manual for more details.
  * Minor bug fixes
    

Version 1.3
  * Unix sockets now remove their file upon close() call
  * close() call now returning a boolean
  * Added Time::Time(bool) - pass 'true' here and the time will be set upon
    construction.
  * A rudimentary test suite has been added ('make check')
  * Utils::toBool() bug fix - it will now *really* return -1 on an unknown
    value given to it
  * AISutil:: namespace is now AIS::util::. It's advised to change/add 'using
    namespace' to reflect this change.
  * SHA1:: routines have changed dramatically, it's advised to read the header
    or the DoxyGen documentation to see all changes. SHA1:: is now
    SHA1_Digest::.
  * Utils::baseXStr() now has network byte ordering
  * Other very minor bugfixes and sprinkles of documentation :)

Version 1.2
  * StringMask:: now inherits from String::, as was originally intended, and
    contains two match routines - matches() and matchesCase(), the former now
    being case-insensitive.

Version 1.1
  * Fixed makefile issues pertaining to the installation of headers.. Oops!
  * Merged in Utils::toBool(), Utils::baseXStr(), and Utils::validateUTF8()
  * Merged in SHA1:: routines, however the OpenSSL integration is not yet
    enabled
  * Other very minor bugfixes

Version 1.0
  * First public release *shock-horror* :)
