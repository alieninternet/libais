Version 1.3
  * Unix sockets now remove their file upon close() call
  * close() call now returning a boolean

    contains two match routines - matches() and matchesCase(), the former now
    being case-insensitive.

Version 1.1
  * Fixed makefile issues pertaining to the installation of headers.. Oops!
  * Merged in Utils::toBool(), Utils::baseXStr(), and Utils::validateUTF8()
  * Merged in SHA1:: routines, however the OpenSSL integration is not yet
    enabled
  * Other very minor bugfixes

Version 1.0
  * First public release *shock-horror* :)
