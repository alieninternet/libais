Version 1.3
  * Unix sockets now remove their file upon close() call
  * close() call now returning a boolean
  * Added Time::Time(bool) - pass 'true' here and the time will be set upon
    construction.
  * A rudimentary test suite has been added ('make check')
  * Utils::toBool() bug fix - it will now *really* return -1 on an unknown
    value given to it
  * AISutil:: namespace is now AIS::util::. It's advised to change/add 'using
    namespace' to reflect this change.

Version 1.2
  * StringMask:: now inherits from String::, as was originally intended, and
    contains two match routines - matches() and matchesCase(), the former now
    being case-insensitive.

Version 1.1
  * Fixed makefile issues pertaining to the installation of headers.. Oops!
  * Merged in Utils::toBool(), Utils::baseXStr(), and Utils::validateUTF8()
  * Merged in SHA1:: routines, however the OpenSSL integration is not yet
    enabled
  * Other very minor bugfixes

Version 1.0
  * First public release *shock-horror* :)
