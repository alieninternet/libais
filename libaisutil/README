    LibAIS (utilities)            Public Release:   version 1.2
  ----------------------
  
This is the first public release of LibAIS. This is not a complete release,
however, since many components of the original LibAIS library have been
removed, pending rewrites.

This release is considered stable, but most likely not highly mature. If you
discover bugs, please submit as much information about it at the following
website. Please include information about your operating system, compiler,
and any other information you feel may be useful - don't be shy :)

This package includes the following components:

 * String functions, which supplement std::string. Includes a basic tokeniser
   and mask matching routines.
 
 * Configuration parser, which is designed to be highly flexible, module,
   and easy to use
   
 * Socket routines, which are supposed to make socket stuff easy to implement
   within software. Socket routines are designed to be simple, not powerful. 
   Note that OpenSSL support was removed from this version, as was a handful
   of other transport types which have not yet been rewritten for the new
   socket base (circa 2001).

 * Very basic time routines, used only to perform basic math on time. It
   includes addition and subtraction of time, plus convertion to popular
   formats.
   
 * SHA1 routine, only because it kept popping up in our code for various
   reasons :)



This public release was prompted by the development of a handful of projects,
primarily KineIRCd (http://kineircd.sf.net/) and various administrative
utilities within the o0ix Linux distribution (http://www.o0ix.org/).


No documentation has been written for the library yet, however minor
documentation including the class structures may be found at
