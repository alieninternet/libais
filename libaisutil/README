  ----------------------
    LibAIS (utilities)            Public Release:   version 1.3
  ----------------------
  
This package currently includes the following components:

 * String functions, which supplement std::string. Includes a basic tokeniser
   and mask matching routines.
 
 * Configuration parser, which is designed to be highly flexible, module,
   and easy to use.
   
 * Socket routines, which are supposed to make socket stuff easy to implement
   within software. Socket routines are designed to be simple, not powerful. 
   Note that OpenSSL support was removed from this version, as was a handful
   of other transport types which have not yet been rewritten for the new
   socket base (circa 2001).

 * Very basic time routines, used only to perform basic math on time. It
   includes addition and subtraction of time, plus convertion to popular
   formats.
   
 * SHA1 routine, only because it kept popping up in our code for various
   reasons


The library is still missing:

 * SSL sockets
 
 * UDP and other unreliable package based sockets

 * The configuration parser has some known caveats which still need addressing


This release is considered stable, but not considered very mature. If you
discover bugs, please collect as much information about the bug as you can,
including your operating system, compiler, and submit a bug report at the
