    LibAIS (utilities)            Public Release:   version 1.0
  ----------------------
  
This is the first public release of LibAIS. This is not a complete release,
however, since many components of the original LibAIS library have been
removed, pending rewrites.

This release is considered stable, but most likely not highly mature. If you
discover bugs, please submit as much information about it at the following
website. Please include information about your operating system, compiler,
and any other information you feel may be useful - don't be shy :)

There are three main components of this package:

 * String functions, which supplement std::string;
 
 * Configuration parser, which is designed to be highly flexible, module,
   and easy to use; and
   
 * Socket routines, which are supposed to make socket stuff easy to implement
   within software. Note that OpenSSL support was removed from this version,
   as was a handful of other transport types which have not yet been rewritten
   for the new socket base (circa 2001).


This public release was prompted by the development of a handful of projects,
primarily KineIRCd (http://kineircd.sf.net/) and various administrative
utilities within the o0ix Linux distribution (http://www.o0ix.org/).
